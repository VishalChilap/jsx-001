      <p className="para">
        Twenty years ago, we began as a small online retailer that only sold
        shoes. Today, we still sell shoes â€” as well as clothing, handbags,
        accessories, and more. That "more" is providing the very best customer
        service, customer experience, and company culture. We aim to inspire the
        world by showing it's possible to simultaneously deliver happiness to
        customer's employees, vendors, shareholders, and the community in
        along-term sustainable way.
      </p>
      <p className="para">
        We hope that in the future people won't even realize we started selling
        shoes online. Instead they all know Zappos as a service company that
        just happens to sell________.
